I am looking for a fulltime job as HTML-developer or Frontend-developer. I wish to work only in office at once. Training and continuous development are important for me. I want to change my profession, because frontend-development is very interesting for me and this is more perspective than my job in an ambulance. I'm tried of my job and I want to sleep at night))))

My skills: HTML5, CSS3, JQUERY, Bootstrap4, CMS Wordpress, Photoshop, Adobe Animate, 3D MAX, CorelDraw, Git.

My code examples:  
```javascript
$(function() {
         /*выпадающее меню*/
         var h = document.getElementsByClassName('menu-item');
	    h[0].addEventListener("mouseover", showSub, false);
	    h[0].addEventListener("mouseout", hideSub, false);

	    function showSub(){
	    	var i = document.getElementsByClassName('submenu');
	    	i[0].style.display = "block";
	    };

	    function hideSub(){
	    	var i = document.getElementsByClassName('submenu');
	    	i[0].style.display = "none";
	    };

I think, that my English level is Pre-Intermediate. I can read English adaptive literature, can speak in English for understanding each other, but English grammar is trouble for me. I can read technical documentation in English using duolingo extension for Chrome.I studied English in depth at the school. Now I learn English by Duolingo.
